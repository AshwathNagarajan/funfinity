# Gamified Learning Interface - Chapters Display

## Overview
This project designs an **interactive, gamified learning interface** for a mobile app. The goal is to make learning engaging, motivating, and visually appealing by representing chapters as themed mini-worlds on a gamified map.

The user flow is:

**Grade Selection → Subject Selection → Chapter World Map → Lessons**

---

## Features

### 1. Grade Selection
* Students select their grade (e.g., Grade 6).  
* Simple, intuitive interface with clear grade buttons.

### 2. Subject Selection
* Subjects are displayed as **themed icons**:
  - **Maths:** Calculator  
  - **Science:** Flask  
  - **Social Science:** Globe  
* Each icon is visually distinctive, colorful, and clickable.

### 3. Chapter World Map
* After selecting a subject, students see **all chapters as floating themed islands**.  
* Chapters are connected via **stairs or bridges**, arranged along a **vertical or horizontal path** like a game map.  
* Chapters unlock sequentially:
  - Locked chapters are **faded with a padlock**.  
  - Unlocked chapters are interactive with **name and progress badge** (stars, medals, coins).  
* Each chapter mini-world has a theme-related visual:
  - **Fractions:** Pizza island with slices  
  - **Plants:** Green forest island  
  - **Solar System:** Space-themed floating planet  
* Smooth animations when tapping a chapter:
  - Zoom into the island before loading lessons  
  - Sub-chapters appear as mini-levels inside each island

### 4. Gamified Features
* **Progress bar** at the top showing % completion of the subject  
* **Reward animations** (coins, fireworks, badges) when a chapter is completed  
* Ability to **revisit completed chapters** for practice  
* Mini-levels for sub-chapters to maintain engagement

### 5. Design & Style
* Cartoonish yet clean flat design (inspired by Duolingo + STEPapp)  
* **Bright colors**, **rounded edges**, and **soft shadows**  
* Playful and motivating background (sky with clouds, stars at higher levels)  
* Intuitive navigation: swipe or tap through chapters

## Goal
The project aims to combine **learning and play** by creating a visually engaging experience where students feel motivated to complete chapters, track progress, and earn rewards. The design emphasizes sequential learning, gamification, and interactivity to enhance user engagement.

---

## Notes
* Use placeholder visuals for icons and mini-worlds initially.  
* Animations can be implemented with CSS transitions or simple JS for interactivity.  
* Focus on **mobile-first responsive design**.  
* Chapters and sub-chapters should clearly indicate progress and completion status.
